# Philosophers

## Overview

The Philosophers Problem is a classic concurrency challenge that explores the synchronization and resource-sharing issues between multiple threads. In this project, philosophers represent threads that alternate between three states: eating, thinking, and sleeping. They sit at a circular table with a shared bowl of spaghetti and a limited number of forks, where each philosopher needs two forks to eat. The simulation adheres to strict rules about timing and resource management, with a focus on preventing starvation and ensuring thread safety using mutexes.

This program, implemented in C, utilizes threads and mutexes to simulate and manage the philosophers' behavior, ensuring proper synchronization and avoiding undefined behavior like deadlocks or race conditions.

## The Problem

One or more philosophers are sitting at a round table with a large bowl of spaghetti in the center.
Each philosopher can perform only one of three actions: eating, thinking, or sleeping. While they are:

Eating: they cannot think or sleep.
Thinking: they cannot sleep or eat.
Sleeping: they cannot eat or think.
There are as many forks on the table as philosophers. To eat, a philosopher must take the fork on their right and the fork on their left, one in each hand. Once they finish eating, they will put both forks back on the table and immediately start sleeping. After waking up, they will begin thinking again.

The simulation stops if a philosopher dies of starvation. To avoid this:

All philosophers must eat and should never starve.
Philosophers do not communicate with each other and cannot predict if another philosopher is about to die.
The main challenge is to ensure that all philosophers eat in time and that no one dies!

## Usage
```
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
- `number_of_philosophers`: The total number of philosophers (threads) sitting at the table.
- `time_to_die`: The maximum amount of time a philosopher can go without eating before "dying" (in milliseconds).
- `time_to_eat`: The time each philosopher spends eating (in milliseconds).
- `time_to_sleep`: The time each philosopher spends sleeping (in milliseconds).
- `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]` (optional): The number of times each philosopher must eat before the simulation ends. If not provided, the philosophers will continue eating and sleeping indefinitely.

### Example Usage:

   ```bash
   ./philo 5 800 200 200 3
 ```
In this example, there are 5 philosophers, each with a maximum time of 800 milliseconds before dying, 200 milliseconds to eat, 200 milliseconds to sleep, and each philosopher must eat 3 times.

## Implementation

The philosophers begin eating in two separate waves, staggered by a few microseconds. First, the even-indexed philosophers start, followed by the odd ones. If the number of philosophers is even, up to half of them can eat simultaneously. However, if the number is odd, only half minus one can eat at the same time, leaving one fork temporarily unused.

After finishing their meal, philosophers sleep for a fixed duration before transitioning to the thinking state. They continue thinking until they gain access to two forks, which happens when the corresponding mutexes become available. Only then can they start eating again.

### Odd Numbers

The most problematic scenario arises when there is an odd number of philosophers, as one of them will inevitably sit out for an entire cycle without eating, significantly increasing the risk of starvation.

Additionally, a major issue that must be addressed is preventing a chain reaction where multiple philosophers hold onto one fork indefinitely, blocking everyone else from eating. To avoid this, philosophers pick up forks in opposite directions:

Even-indexed philosophers grab their right fork first.

Odd-indexed philosophers grab their left fork first.

### Delays

Another critical scenario occurs when a philosopher who has already skipped one eating cycle is about to eat, but a newly awakened neighbor steals a fork, forcing them to skip yet another turn. This could lead to starvation, even if it was not supposed to happen.

To mitigate this, a slight delay is introduced for odd-indexed philosophers when waking up, ensuring that the first and last philosopher do not wake up at the same time. This prevents unfair fork stealing and reduces the risk of starvation in scenarios with an odd number of participants.

### Monitoring

To track the philosophersâ€™ status, an extra monitoring thread is created. This thread continuously checks:

- How many times each philosopher has eaten.
- How long they have gone without eating.

If a philosopher exceeds the time_to_die threshold, or if all philosophers have reached the required number of meals (if this option is set), the simulation terminates immediately, printing the corresponding message.
